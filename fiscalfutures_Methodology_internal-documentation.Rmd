# Data Creation and Cleaning

- Do the FOIA request. In a week or so, they send the expenditure and revenue data as excel files.   
- Checks whether there are any new agencies, re-used funds etc. Create a list of funds, agencies, fund names, etc. for the new year and compare it to the immediate prior year to identify new funds.   
- Update the funds_ab_in file which shows the use of funds. Use criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the all-funds frame.   
- Change the variable names to be consistent with other files such as AGENCYNAME --> agency_name   

- Once variable names are shared over all years of data, combine past years with newest year. All revenue files are in a `revenue` folder that I reference when I set the working directory. When adding new fiscal years, put the the newest year of data for revenue and expenditures in their respective folders. 

Normally, when your receive the new fiscal year files from the Comptrollers office, you will need to change the variable names so that they are consistent with past years. This is an example of reading in the new file and changing the variable names. They seem to change almost every year in the file received from the FOIA so if the code breaks here, check to make sure that the columns you are trying to rename exist and are spelled correctly! Once variables are the same, you will want to save the file as a csv file in its Revenue/Expenditure file and bind all past years and the current year together in one dataframe. 

```{r rename-variables}

#Example code below: Read in excel file and rename columns so that it plays well with the other years' files.
revenue_fy22 <- read_xlsx("Fis_Fut_Rev_2022_Final.xlsx") %>% 
  rename(fy = 'FY',
         fund = 'FUND',
         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',
         agency = 'AGENCY',
         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',
         source = 'REVENUE SOURCE',
         source_name = 'REV SRC NAME',
         receipts = 'AMOUNT'
  ) 

exp_fy22 <- read_xlsx("Fis_Fut_Exp_2022_Final.xlsx") %>% 
  rename(fy = 'FY',
         fund = 'FUND',
         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',
         agency = 'AGENCY',
         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',
         appr_org = 'ORGANIZATION',
         org_name = 'ORGANIZATION NAME',
         obj_seq_type = 'APPROPRIATION',
         wh_approp_name = 'APPROPRIATION NAME',
        # exp_net_xfer = 'NET OF TRANS AMOUNT',
         expenditure = 'EXPENDED'
  ) 

# %>%
#   # these come from ioc_source file after merging
#   mutate(data_source = "exp IOC Aug 2022",
#          object = ,
#          seq = ,
#          type = ,
#          fund_cat = FIND_COLUMN, #create fund_cat column
#          fund_cat_name = FIND_NAME) # create fund_cat_name column



```

 
The code chunk below takes the .dta files for all fiscal years before FY 2022 and binds them together.  Variable names were manually changed by past researchers so that they were consistent across years.

For FY 2023 and after, .dta files can be avoided entirely and .csv or excel files will be used. All files before this year had been saved and passed on as .dta files for Stata code before the transition to R in Fall 2022.  For years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files after binding the dta files together. Variable names must identical to merge files together.

```{r create-rev-csv-FY22, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files after binding the dta files.
setwd("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/revenue")

allrevfiles22 = list.files(path = "C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/revenue",  pattern = ".dta") %>%  lapply(read_dta) %>% bind_rows
#Fy21: 62294 observations, 13 variables
#FY22: 65094 obs, 13 vars

write_csv(allrevfiles22, "allrevfiles22.csv")




setwd("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/expenditures")

allexpfiles22 = list.files(path = "C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/expenditures",  pattern = ".dta") %>%  lapply(read_dta) %>% bind_rows

#fy21 213372 observations, 20 variables
# fy22 225587 obs, 21 vars.

write_csv(allexpfiles22, "allexpfiles22.csv")


```


Code below reads in the csv files created in chunks above (allrevfiles.csv and allrexpfiles.csv). These files contain all years of data combined into one file BEFORE any recoding is done. Do not use this file for summing categories because it is just an inbetween step before recoding revenue and expenditure categories. 

```{r readCSVs}
# combined in past chunks called create-rev-csv and create-exp-csv

allrevfiles22 <- read_csv("allrevfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded
allexpfiles22 <- read_csv("allexpfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded

```







 
```{r eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# not sure if this chunk is needed or useful at all. 
# Something similar was done in old stata code but not consistently and it wasn't used.
# Agency == 799 for Statutory transfers 
#  Object == 1993 is for Interfund cash transfers  
exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% 
  mutate(transfer = ifelse(org_name == "TRANSFERS", 1, 0),
         trans_agency = ifelse(),
         trans_type = ifelse())
```

## Inspecting new FY22 data files

Data files for closed years have been obtained from IOC. The numbers of funds, agencies, organizations, and revenue sources below were found by using pivot tables in the codebook files in the FY2022 Box folder. This could also be done using R and grouping new files by fund, agency, source number, source names, etc..

Revenue File:  
- 684 Fund Numbers   
- 80 Agencies  
- 1184 Revenue source numbers
- 1156 revenue source names

Expenditure File:  
- 708 Fund Numbers   
- 107 Agencies   
- 98 Organization Numbers   
- 313 Organization names  

### Finding new agencies and funds

General steps:  
1. Identify new and reused funds for newest fiscal year. 
2. Recode funds to take into account different fund numbers/names over the years. See [Recoding New and Reused Funds] for code chunk that does this. 
3. Update fund_ab_in_2022.xlsx with any changes from previous fiscal year.   


**New Agencies, Funds, and Organizations from Expenditure files:**

- Using the code below, I found 2 agencies, multiple funds, and a couple organizations that had not been specifically mentioned in the funds_ab_in file - AWM, FY2022.
  - Note: One new org name and org number combo has an expenditure of $600 million for pensions payment. Investigate later.  

```{r}

allrevfiles22 <- read_csv("allrevfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded
allexpfiles22 <- read_csv("allexpfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded

#### From Expenditure Data #####

# 4 org number and org name combos are new for FY2022:
anti_join(orgs22, orgs_past, by = c("appr_org", "org_name")) %>% arrange(appr_org)
```


**New Revenue Funds, Sources, and New Agencies:**

```{r}
#### From Revenue Data ####



# agencies_past # 108 agencies ever
agencies_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(agency == as.character(agency)) %>% group_by(agency, agency_name) %>% unique() %>% summarize(Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% drop_na()


# agencies22 # 80 agencies this year
agencies22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(agency == as.character(agency)) %>% group_by(agency, agency_name) %>% summarize(Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))

# 0 new agencies in revenue data this year
anti_join(agencies22, agencies_past, by = c("agency", "agency_name")) %>% arrange(agency)


funds_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(fund == as.character(fund)) %>% group_by(fund, fund_name) %>% summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% drop_na()

funds22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(fund == as.character(fund)) %>% group_by(fund, fund_name) %>%  summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% unique() %>% drop_na()

# 19 revenue funds were in FY22 revenue data that were not in past data 
# some could be small fund name changes
anti_join(funds22, funds_past, by = c("fund", "fund_name")) %>% arrange(fund)



sources_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(source == as.character(source)) %>% group_by(source, source_name) %>% summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% drop_na()

sources22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(source == as.character(source)) %>% group_by(source, source_name) %>%  summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% unique()


# 20 revenue sources were in FY22 data that were not in past data 
# some could be small source name changes:
anti_join(sources22, sources_past, by = c("source", "source_name")) %>% arrange(source)

```

Sources 2737 through 2756 were not found in the IOC_source file so I added them. They do NOT have a rev_type until the Fiscal Futures researchers discuss which revenue type the sources fall under and if they should be included in the analysis in general.


### Recoding New and Reused Funds

New funds will need to be manually added to the funds_ab_in excel file and determined if they should or should not be included in Fiscal Future calculations. __Copy info from word file here on how to add funds to excel file__.

For funds that were reused once, a 9 replaces the 0 as the first digit. If reused twice, then the first two values are 10.   
- Ex. 0350 --> 9350 because its use changed.   
- Ex. 0367 becomes 10367 because its use has changed twice now. There was fund 0367 originally, then its use changed and it was recoded as 9367, and now it changed again so it is a 10367.  
- Excel file also has alternative ways to name funds (e.g. 0397-A and 0397-B) and variables for the year that the fund stopped being used. These have not been updated consistently over the years but it is useful information when trying to find any coding mistakes from the past.   

New or reused funds revenue file recoding:
```{r recode-rev-funds}
# if first character is a 0, replace with a 9 if its purpose has changed

rev_1998_2022 <- allrevfiles22 %>%

```

The `funds_ab_in.xlsx` file contains all funds that have existed since 1998, if they still exist, indicates if fund numbers have been reused for varying purposes, and is updated yearly with new fund numbers used by the IOC.

```{r create-exp_temp, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
funds_ab_in_2022 = readxl::read_excel("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/funds_ab_in_2022.xlsx")


exp_temp <- exp_1998_2022 %>% 
  arrange(fund, fy) %>%
  filter(expenditure != 0) %>%             # keeps everything that is not zero
# join  funds_ab_in_2021  to exp_temp
 left_join(funds_ab_in_2022, by = "fund")  # matches most recent fund number 

```

- the initial combined years of data are saved as dataframes named `exp_1998_2022` and `rev_1998_2022`. These are then saved as exp_temp and rev_temp while recoding variables. This is BEFORE category groups are created and cleaned below. `exp_temp` and `rev_temp` are only temporary files; do not use for aggregating totals yet! 


```{r remove-all_obs_df, include=FALSE}
#include = FALSE in the chunk settings run the code but do not include the chunk in the html output

# remove from computer memory to free up space (in case your computer needs it)
rm(allexpfiles22)
rm(allrevfiles22)
rm(exp_fy22)
rm(revenue_fy22)
```

Update Agencies: Some agencies have merged with others or changed names over time.
```{r agencies-exp}
# recodes old agency numbers to consistent agency number
exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% 
  mutate(agency = case_when(
    (agency=="438"| agency=="475" |agency == "505") ~ "440",
    # financial institution &  professional regulation &
     # banks and real estate  --> coded as  financial and professional reg
    agency == "473" ~ "588", # nuclear safety moved into IEMA
    (agency =="531" | agency =="577") ~ "532", # coded as EPA
    (agency =="556" | agency == "538") ~ "406", # coded as agriculture
    agency == "560" ~ "592", # IL finance authority (fire trucks and agriculture stuff)to state fire marshal
    agency == "570" & fund == "0011" ~ "494",   # city of Chicago road fund to transportation
    TRUE ~ (as.character(agency)))) 
```



For aggregating revenue, use the rev_1998_2022 dataframe, join the funds_ab_in_2022 file to it, and then join the ioc_source_type file to the dataset. Remember: You need to update the funds_ab_in and ioc_source_type file every year! 

```{r create-rev-temp, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# fund info to revenue for all years
rev_temp <- inner_join(rev_1998_2022, funds_ab_in_2022, by = "fund") %>% arrange(source)

# need to update the ioc_source_type file every year! 
ioc_source_type <- readxl::read_xlsx("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/ioc_source_updated22_AWM.xlsx")

rev_temp <- left_join(rev_temp, ioc_source_type, by = "source")
# automatically used source, source name does not match for the join to work using source_name



# recodes old agency numbers to consistent agency number
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(agency = case_when(
    (agency=="438"| agency=="475" |agency == "505") ~ "440",
    # financial institution &  professional regulation &
     # banks and real estate  --> coded as  financial and professional reg
    agency == "473" ~ "588", # nuclear safety moved into IEMA
    (agency =="531" | agency =="577") ~ "532", # coded as EPA
    (agency =="556" | agency == "538") ~ "406", # coded as agriculture
    agency == "560" ~ "592", # IL finance authority (fire trucks and agriculture stuff)to state fire marshal
    agency == "570" & fund == "0011" ~ "494",   # city of Chicago road fund to transportation
    TRUE ~ (as.character(agency)))) 
```

# Overall Fiscal Health

## Pension Discusion

__For yearly expenditure calculations, the state contributions to the pension funds (object = 4430) should be the expenditure included for pensions. If trying to look at the bigger fiscal health picture and include unfunded liabilities and in/out flows, then items like purchase of investments and POB spikes in trends that occurred from policy changes should be included. Again, State contributions TO the pension funds are the expenditures BUT an additional graph/discussion on the employer contributions, employee contributions, and benefits paid out should be included and considered for additional context on Illinois' situation.__

Pension expenditures referenced in the analysis are based on state payments to the following pension systems:  

• Teachers Retirement System (TRS)  
- New POB bond in 2019: Accelerated Bond Fund paid benefits in advance as lump sum   
• State Employee Retirement System (SERS)  
• State University Retirement System (SURS)  
• Judges Retirement System (JRS)  
• General Assembly Retirement System (GARS)

**Additional context:**   
For the $10 billion in 2004, they borrowed money and invested it in pension portfolio and hoped that the returns would be greater than the interest on the debt. If returns>interest, then they increased the pension funds and it was a good idea. Otherwise a short term band-aid causes even more problems later. This added a significant amount to the unfunded pension liabilities. In 2010 and 2011, POBs were used a different way. POBs served as a type of general borrowing for the state by borrowing against what was owed to the pension systems and using that revenue that should have funded pensions to instead subsidize the cost of providing core services.  Illinois borrowed money (POBs) and used it to pay for government services. A very classic example of using a one shot-revenue source to fill a budget gap that then costs more in the long run due to increased unfunded liabilities and interest on the borrowed money. - "Basket Case" by Dye 2015

In 2019 lawmakers offered a pension buyout plan where members could opt-out of their future benefits for a lump sum. However, few people participated in the buyout plan and very little savings have occurred so far. The buyout plan has been extended to 2026 in hopes that more people participate in it. Description of Pension Obligation Acceleration Bond at this [link](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/003003300K7.7.htm). Proceeds of bonds go into pension obligation accelaration fund (which are not included as a revenue source) and the fund is only used to make accelerated pension benefit payments. The pension stabilization fund (0319) is money put into the pension funds to help with the long-run fiscal imbalance. 

**Data coding details**    
- State pension contributions are largely captured with object=4431. **(State payments into pension fund)**    
  - includes 8 billion payment in 2004 that creates large peak in expenditure graphs   
  - Object 4431 does not capture recent pension stabilization fund which is fund = 0319, object = 1900 and has $300 million investment in FY2022.  


- Fund=0475 is the Municipal Retirement Fund - Not included because state just helps collect and disperse local pension funds. IMRF is most funded pension fund in Illinois.  Fund ends in 2015. All were considered purchase of investments. 

- IOC objects 1160-1165 are all retirement objects. I believe they are employer contributions into the pension fund?

- Some expenditures with object=4430 were paid for with Pension obligation bond funds (fund == 0825). In past years, some POB funded expenditures were moved to revenue side. Code logic was unclear. We are no longer doing this as of FY2021.   

- Other types of pension expenditures to consider when looking at pension funds: Pension obligation acceleration bond, state pension obligation bond reimbursements, pension pickup, accelerated pension buy-out (bond financed funds)   

  
  
Other items to be aware of that may contain useful pension context:   

- object = 1298 is for Purchase of Investments and is excluded from analysis. In past analyses, there were a couple of exceptions during 2010 and 2011.      
  - Purchase of Investments captures the pension obligation bonds issued in 2003-2004 and again in 2010-2011.  
- object = 1900 for pension stabilization is under lump sums  
- object = 1167 and 1168 is for Employer pension contributions but is not used by IOC yet as of FY2022.  
- object 4900 is awards and grants lump sum   
 
 
Employer contributions for pensions are excluded from analysis to avoid double counting the cost of pensions. Expenditures with object 4430 for pensions, benefits, and annuities  appears in items from funds 0473, 0477, 0479, 0481, (TRS, JRS, SERS, GARS), 0755, 0786, 0787, 0788, 0789, 0799 (deferred compensation plan, GAR excess benefit, JRS excess benefit, SER excess benefit, TRS excess benefit, state university retirement system) are NOT included in the analysis. All are coded with in_ff=0 in the fund_ab_in.xlsx file of funds.

Employer contributions and state pension contributions are an example of an expenditure being double counted if both are included. 

### Pension Contributions

  
rev_type = 51 is for retirement/pension contributions from both employers and employees. These contributions from employers and employees are not considered a revenue source from the state and are excluded from the Fiscal Futures analysis. However, it is still important to understand the money going in and out of then pension funds even if it is not included as a yearly expenditure or revenue. Retirement contribution revenue is graphed below.
```{r}

## Debt Service Discussion


Debt Service expenditures include interest payment on both short-term and long-term debt. We do not include escrow or principal payments. 

**Decision from Sept 30 2022:** We are no longer including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect. 

**Objects:**    
8813 interest **INCLUDE AS COST**  
8811 is for principle **EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure**  
8841 is for escrow payments **EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure**  
8800 is for capital projects debt service (e.g. Build Illinois Bonds, Civic Center, Tollway **EXCLUDE tollway in debt cost**
  - Note: debt principle and interest are both included in capital projects because they are combined in the data observations; bond proceeds are not considered a revenue source. Can't include capital projects interest as easily as the GO bonds. 


**Obj_seq_type:**       
- Exclude: Bond principle payments: obj_seq_type == 88110008   
- Exclude: Short term borrowing principle: obj_seq_type == 88110108  
- Include: General Obligation Bond Interest: obj_seq_type == 88130000 & 88130008  
- Include: Interest on short-term borrowing: 88130108  
- Exclude: Escrow payment == 88410008  
- Include: Build IL Bonds, capital projects principal AND interest  
  - Tollway is obj_seq_type == 88000055, filter out fund == 0455 to remove tollway  
  - fund == 0455 is the IL State Toll Highway fund, items mostly for operations and maintenance  

```{r tollway}

Filtering for interest on short term borrowing and GO bonds (8813_ _ _ _) and GO bond principal amounts (88130008).   
- object == 8813 is for interest but obj_seq_type is used just to be more specific below.    


Looking only at general obligation principal payments and interest payments:

```{r}
# GO bond principal and GO bond interest
GObond_debt <- exp_temp %>% 
  filter(obj_seq_type == "88110008" |obj_seq_type == "88130000" | obj_seq_type == "88130008") %>% 
  group_by(fy, obj_seq_type) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(expenditure, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = obj_seq_type, values_from = sum) %>% 
  mutate(principal = `88110008`,
         interest = sum(`88130008`+`88130000`, na.rm = TRUE),
         ratio = (as.numeric(interest)/as.numeric(principal)))

GObond_debt %>% select(principal, interest, ratio) %>%
  mutate(across(principal:interest, ~format(., big.mark= ",", scientific = F)))

GObond_debt %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=principal, color = "Principal"))+ 
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=interest, color = "Interest")) + 
  labs(title = "General Obligation principal and interest payments")
```

Looking only at short term borrowing principal and interest payments:
```{r}
# short term borrowing, first observation is in 2004?
short_debt <- exp_temp %>% 
  filter(obj_seq_type == 88110108 |obj_seq_type == 88130108) %>% 
  group_by(fy, obj_seq_type) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(expenditure, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = obj_seq_type, values_from = sum) %>% 
  mutate(principal = `88110108`,
         interest = `88130108`,
         ratio = (as.numeric(interest)/as.numeric(principal)))

short_debt %>% select(principal, interest, ratio) %>%
  mutate(across(principal:interest, ~format(., big.mark= ",",  scientific = F)))

short_debt %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x=fy, y=principal/1000000, fill = "Principal"))+ 
  geom_col(aes(x=fy, y=interest/1000000, fill = "Interest")) + 
  labs(title = "Short Term Borrowing: Principal and Interest Payments")

```

When including short term borrowing and normal debt service, the debt ratio seems more normal and the total interest and principal payments over the years are smoothed out. 


Principal and interest amounts calculated exclude the Illinois Tollway debt service and debt for capital projects. Capital projects debt service is examined below:
```{r}
capitalprojects <- exp_temp %>%filter(object == "8800")

all_debt <- exp_temp %>% 
  filter(fund != "0455" & (object == "8811" |object == "8813" | object == "8800") )%>% 
  group_by(fy, object) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(expenditure, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = object, values_from = sum) %>% 
  mutate(principal = `8811`,
         interest = `8813`,
         CapitalProjects = `8800`,
         ratio = (as.numeric(interest)/as.numeric(principal)))

all_debt %>% select(principal, interest, CapitalProjects, ratio) %>%
  mutate(across(principal:CapitalProjects, ~format(., big.mark= ",", scientific = F)))

all_debt %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=principal/1000000, color = "Principal"))+ 
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=interest/1000000, color = "Interest"))+
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y = CapitalProjects / 1000000, color = "Capital Projects"))+
  labs(y = "Debt ($Millions)",
       title = "Principal and Interest payments", subtitle = "Principal and interest from short term borrowing and GO Bonds debt service", caption = "Capital projects does not include Illinois tollway debt service.
       Capital projects include interest and principal values as one value and cannot be sepearated.")


```

Capital projects include the IL Civic Center and Build Illinois Bonds. Tollway principal and interest has been dropped from the State's Debt Service expenditure but is counted in the Illinois Tollway Expenditure cost.


## State Employee Healthcare Discussion

State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for "health care coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance act." The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund. Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.

**Coding details**  
In FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478 to 416 in data.)

Employer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare provision. All employer group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180. BUT the last two fiscal years were coded as 1900 instead of 1180 for lump sums instead of employer contributions      
- anything to do with pandemic money categorization?   



Fund = 0457 is "Group insurance premium", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0193 is "Local govt health insurance reserve", in=ff = 0  
fund = 0477 is "Community College Health Insurance", in=ff = 0.     
- had large amount in early years  
Fund = 0907 = health insurance reserve, in_ff = 1  
Fund = 9939 is "group self-insurers' insolv", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in_ff = 0  
Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in_ff = 1   




- eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an employer contribution of some type to some fund   
- eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an employer contribution to health insurance


```{r healthcare-employer-contributions}
health_ins_reserve <- exp_temp %>% filter(fund == "0907") %>%  group_by(fy) %>% 
    summarize(fund_0907 = sum(expenditure)) 

health_ins_reserve %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=fund_0907)) + geom_line()

# object 1180 is inconsistently coded over time form the IOC 
# object 1180 should be employer contributions to healthcare group insurance
employer_contributions <- exp_temp %>% filter(object == "1180") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(object1180 = sum(expenditure)) 

employer_contributions%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=object1180)) + geom_line()


employer_contributions2 <- exp_temp %>% filter(object == "1180" & fund=="0001") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(object1180 = sum(expenditure)) 

employer_contributions2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=object1180)) + geom_line()


# examine group insurance totals per year
group_ins2 <- exp_temp %>% 
  mutate(eehc = ifelse(
    # group insurance contributions for 1998-2005 and 2013-present
    # CMS took over health insurance in 2013
   fund == "0001" & (object == "1180" | object =="1900") & agency == "416" & appr_org=="20", 1, 0) )%>% 
  mutate(eehc = ifelse(
    # group insurance contributions for 2006-2012
    # health insurance was in healthcare and family services, agency 478 for a few years
    fund == "0001" & object == "1180" & agency == "478" & appr_org=="80", 1, eehc) )%>%
  filter(eehc == 1) %>% 
    group_by(fy) %>% 
    summarize(dropped_group_premiums = sum(expenditure))


group_ins2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=dropped_group_premiums)) + geom_line()


```


If observation is a group insurance contribution, then the expenditure amount is set to $0 (essentially dropped from analysis).

### Health Insurance Premiums from Employees

Employee insurance premiums for healthcare are a revenue source for the state in the IOC data but are not included the Fiscal Futures analysis and fiscal gap calculations. 

> Last month I said: In order to get the true cost of State Employee Healthcare, total employee insurance premiums should be subtracted from the healthcare expenditure total (exp_904 - premiums). Gather all employee premiums into `emp_premiums` and subtract it from the Expenditure table after aggregating and pivoting steps.

### Tax refunds 

Aggregate expenditures: Save tax refunds as negative revenue. Code refunds to match the rev_type codes (02=income taxes, 03 = corporate income taxes, 06=sales tax, 09=motor fuel tax, 24=insurance taxes and fees, 35 = all other tax refunds).


```{r tax-refunds}
## negative revenue becomes tax refunds

tax_refund_long <- exp_temp %>%           # fund != "0401" # removes State Trust Funds
  filter(fund != "0401" & (object=="9910"|object=="9921"|object=="9923"|object=="9925")) %>%
  # keeps these objects which represent revenue, insurance, treasurer,and financial and professional reg tax refunds
  mutate(refund = case_when(
    fund=="0278" & sequence == "00" ~ "02", # for income tax refund
    fund=="0278" & sequence == "01" ~ "03", # tax administration and enforcement and tax operations become corporate income tax refund
     fund == "0278" & sequence == "02" ~ "02",
    object=="9921" ~ "21",                # inheritance tax and estate tax refund appropriation
    object=="9923" ~ "09",                # motor fuel tax refunds

    fund=="0378" & object=="9925" ~ "24", # insurance privilege tax refund
    fund=="0001" & object=="9925" ~ "35", # all other taxes
      T ~ "CHECK"))                       # if none of the items above apply to the observations, then code them as CHECK 

    
exp_temp <- left_join(exp_temp, tax_refund_long) %>%
  mutate(refund = ifelse(is.na(refund),"not refund", as.character(refund)))

tax_refund <- tax_refund_long %>% 
  group_by(refund, fy)%>%
  summarize(refund_amount = sum(expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = refund, values_from = refund_amount, names_prefix = "ref_") %>%
  mutate_all(~replace_na(.,0)) %>%
  arrange(fy)

tax_refund %>% pivot_longer( ref_02:ref_35, names_to = "Refund Type", values_to = "Amount") %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x=fy,y=Amount, group = `Refund Type`, color = `Refund Type`))+
  labs(title = "Refund Types", caption = "Refunds are excluded from Expenditure totals and instead subtracted from Revenue totals") + 
  labs(title = "Tax refunds", 
       caption = "Rev_type codes: 02=income taxes, 03=corporate income taxes, 06=sales tax, 09=motor fuel tax, 
       24=insurance taxes and fees, 35 = all other tax refunds." )

# remove the items we recoded in tax_refund_long
exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% filter(refund == "not refund")


```

`tax_refund` amounts are removed from expenditure totals and subtracted from revenue totals (since they were tax refunds).


### Pension Expenditures


_Earlier I argued that `pension_rev` should be subtracted from the state pension expenditures because employee contributions to pensions were a revenue source. If we wanted net pension cost, then we should subtract employee contributions from pension costs BUT as of 11/30/2022, I have changed my mind. All rev==51 pension contributions should be excluded from analysis BUT pensions as a whole are discussed in the 'Pension Discussion' section earlier in the document._


__For yearly expenditure calculations, the state contributions to the pension funds (object = 4431) should be the expenditure included for pensions. If trying to look at the bigger fiscal health picture and include unfunded liabilities and in/out flows, then items like purchase of investments and large spikes that occurred from policy changes should be included. Again, State contributions TO the pension funds are the expenditures BUT an additional graph/discussion on the employer contributions, employee contributions (revenue source), and benefits paid out to employees (object = 4430) should be included and considered for additional context on Illinois' situation.__

State payments to the following pension systems:  

• Teachers Retirement System (TRS)  
- New POB bond in 2019: Accelerated Bond Fund paid benefits in advance as lump sum   
• State Employee Retirement System (SERS)  
• State University Retirement System (SURS)  
• Judges Retirement System (JRS)  
• General Assembly Retirement System (GARS)  

- Includes pension stabilization fund = 0319, object = 1900 and the $300 million investment in FY2022.    
- State pension contributions are largely captured with object=4431. **(State payments into pension fund)**    
  - includes 8 billion payment in 2004 that creates large peak in expenditure graphs   
  - does not capture recent pension stabilization payments   
- Some expenditures with object=4430 are paid for with Pension obligation bond funds (fund == 0825). In past years, some POB funded expenditures were moved to revenue side. We are no longer doing this as of FY2021.    

Modify exp_temp and move all state pension contributions to their own group (901):
```{r pensions}
exp_temp <-  exp_temp %>% 
  arrange(fund) %>%
  mutate(pension = case_when( 
   (object=="4431") ~ 1, # 4431 = easy to find pension payments INTO fund
   
 # (object>"1159" & object<"1166") & fund != "0183" & fund != "0193"   ~ 2, 
   # objects 1159 to 1166 are all considered Retirement by Comptroller, 
  # Excluded - employer contributions from agencies/organizations/etc.

  # state borrowed money from pension funds to pay for core services during 2010 and 2011. 
  # used to fill budget gap and push problems to the future.
 

 fund == "0319" ~ 4, #pension stabilization fund, included
                                        TRUE ~ 0) )

### Drop Interfund transfers

- object == 1993 is for interfund cash transfers  
- agency == 799 is for statutory transfers  
- object == 1298 is for purchase of investments and is not spending EXCEPT for pensions in 2010 and 2011 (and were recoded already to object == "4431"). Over 168,000 observations remain.  

```{r drop-transfers}

transfers_drop <- exp_temp %>% filter(
  agency == "799" | # statutory transfers
           object == "1993" |  # interfund cash transfers
           object == "1298") # purchase of investments

exp_temp <- anti_join(exp_temp, transfers_drop)

#transfers_drop %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(expenditure = sum(expenditure)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=expenditure)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Dropped Transfers", caption = "Includes statutory transfers, interfund cash transfers, and purchase of investments")
```


### State employee healthcare costs


State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for "health care coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance act." The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund. We subtract the share that came from employee contributions. Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.

In FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478 to 416 in data.)

Employer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare. All employer group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180. BUT the last two fiscal years were coded as 1900 instead of 1180 for lump sums instead of employer contributions      
- anything to do with pandemic money categorization?   



Fund = 0457 is "Group insurance premium", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0193 is "Local govt health insurance reserve", in=ff = 0  
fund = 0477 is "Community College Health Insurance", in=ff = 0.     
- had large amount in early years  
Fund = 0907 = health insurance reserve, in_ff = 1  
Fund = 9939 is "group self-insurers' insolv", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in_ff = 0  
Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in_ff = 1   




- eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an employer contribution of some type to some fund   
- eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an employer contribution to health insurance

> This code chunk above for dealing with group insurance means that healthcare costs need to be added to expenditures after other group names are assigned.

### Local Transfers

Separate transfers to local from parent agencies that come from DOR(492) or Transportation (494). Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures, not negative revenue.

The share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are NOT included.)

The five corresponding revenue items are:  

• Local share of Personal Income Tax   
• Local share of General Sales Tax   
• Personal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income  
• Personal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities  
• Local share of Motor Fuel Tax 
  - Transportation Renewal Fund 0952  
  
Notes - these don't exit:
- fund=="0627" & object=="4472"~ "976" # public transportation   
- fund=="0648" & object=="4472" ~ "976",

### Debt Service


Debt Service expenditures include interest payment on both short-term and long-term debt. We do not include escrow or principal payments. 

**Decision from Sept 30 2022:** We are no longer including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect. 

```{r debt-service}

### Medicaid

__Medicaid.__ That portion of the Healthcare and Family Services (or Public Aid in earlier years, agency code 478) budget for Medical (appr_organization code 65) for awards and grants (object codes 4400 and 4900).  

> State CURE will remain in the Medicaid expenditure category due to the nature of it being federal funds providing public health services and funding to locations that provide public services.

- Uses same appropriation name of "HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELIEF" and fund == 0793 and obj_seq_type == 49000000. So can defend the "mistake" of including healthcare provider relief as Medicaid expenditure. 


```{r Medicaid-check, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
medicaid_check <- exp_temp %>% filter(agency=="478" & (appr_org=="01" | appr_org == "65" | appr_org=="88") & (object=="4900" | object=="4400"))
# This includes the State CURE fund

medicaid_check %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(sum = sum(expenditure)) %>% arrange(-fy)  # looks good I think AWM

# if we want state CURE as public health or other group number
# exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% mutate(group = if_else(fund == "0324" & agency=="478" & appr_org == "65" & object=="4900", "478", as.character(group)))

All expenditures recoded but not aggregated: Allows for inspection of individual expenditures within larger categories. This stage of the data is extremely useful for investigating almost all questions we have about the data. 

Note that these are the raw figures BEFORE we take the additional steps:   

- Subtract employee insurance premiums from State Employee Healthcare expenditures  
- Subtract tax refunds from tax revenues by revenue type.  

## Modify  Revenue data

For aggregating revenue, use the rev_1998_2022 dataframe, join the funds_ab_in_2022 file to it, and then join the ioc_source_type file to the dataset. Remember: You need to update the funds_ab_in and ioc_source_type file every year! 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# fund info to revenue for all years
rev_temp <- inner_join(rev_1998_2022, funds_ab_in_2022, by = "fund") %>% arrange(source)

rev_temp <- left_join(rev_temp, ioc_source_type, by = "source")
# automatically used source, source name does not match for the join to work using source_name

### Health Insurance Premiums from Employees

Employee insurance premiums for healthcare are a revenue source for the state. In order to get the true cost of State Employee Healthcare, total employee insurance premiums should be subtracted from the healthcare expenditure total (exp_904 - premiums). Gather all employee premiums into `emp_premiums` and subtract it from the Expenditure table after aggregating and pivoting steps.

0120 = ins prem-option life
0120 = ins prem-optional life/univ

0347 = optional health - HMO
0348 = optional health - dental 
0349 = optional health - univ/local SI
0350 = optional health - univ/local
0351 = optional health - retirement
0352 = optional health - retirement SI
0353 = optional health - retire/dental
0354 = optional health - retirement hmo

2199-2209 = various HMOs, dental, health plans from Health Insurance Reserve (fund)

```{r step-3.6-insurance-premiums}

#collect optional insurance premiums to fund 0907 for use in eehc expenditure  
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(employee_premiums = ifelse(
    fund=="0907" & (source=="0120"| source=="0121"| (source>"0345" & source<"0357")|(source>"2199" & source<"2209")), 1, 0),
    
    # adds more rev_type codes
    rev_type = case_when(
      fund =="0427" ~ "12", # pub utility tax
      fund == "0742" | fund == "0473" ~ "24", # insurance and fees
      fund == "0976" ~ "36",# receipts from rev producing
      fund == "0392" |fund == "0723" ~ "39", # licenses and fees
      fund == "0656" ~ "78", #all other rev sources
      TRUE ~ as.character(rev_type)))
# if not mentioned, then rev_type as it was



# # optional insurance premiums = employee insurance premiums
# emp_premium <- rev_temp %>%
#   group_by(fy, employee_premiums) %>%
#   summarize(employee_premiums_sum = sum(receipts)/1000000) %>%
#   filter(employee_premiums == 1) %>%
#   rename(year = fy) %>% 
#   select(-employee_premiums)

emp_premium_long <- rev_temp %>%  filter(employee_premiums == 1)
# 381 observations have employee premiums == 1


rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% filter(employee_premiums != 1)


```

Employee premiums on the revenue side should have receipts coded as $0 or be dropped using anti_join(). 


### Transfers in and Out: 

**I don't have much faith in the transfers in and out steps- AWM**

I am currently choosing to exclude the totals from this step. Overall, this decreases the total revenues in "All Other Revenues" by a few million dollars.

- in_from_out <- c("0847", "0867", "1175", "1176", "1177", "1178", "1181", "1182", "1582", "1592", "1745", "1982", "2174", "2264")   
- See the methodology document for the list of what these sources/funds are. 


```{r step-3.8}
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  filter(in_ff == 1) %>% 
  mutate(local = ifelse(is.na(local), 0, local)) %>% # drops all revenue observations that were coded as "local == 1"
  filter(local != 1)

# 1175 doesnt exist?
in_from_out <- c("0847", "0867", "1175", "1176", "1177", "1178", "1181", "1182", "1582", "1592", "1745", "1982", "2174", "2264")

# what does this actually include:
# all are items with rev_type = 75 originally. 
in_out_df <- rev_temp %>%
  mutate(infromout = ifelse(source %in% in_from_out, 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(infromout == 1)

rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(rev_type_new = ifelse(source %in% in_from_out, "76", rev_type))
# if source contains any of the codes in in_from_out, code them as 76 (all other rev).
```


```{r droprevtypes}
# revenue types to drop
drop_type <- c("32", "45", "51", 
               "66", "72", "75", "79", "98")

# drops Blank, Student Fees, Retirement contributions, proceeds/investments,
# bond issue proceeds, interagency receipts, cook IGT, Prior year refunds.


rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% filter(!rev_type_new %in% drop_type)
# keep observations that do not have a revenue type mentioned in drop_type

table(rev_temp$rev_type_new)

rev_temp %>% 
  group_by(fy, rev_type_new) %>% 
  summarize(total_reciepts = sum(receipts)/1000000) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = rev_type_new, values_from = total_reciepts, names_prefix = "rev_") 

# combines smallest 4  categories to to "Other"
# they were the 4 smallest in past years, are they still the 4 smallest? 

rev_temp <- rev_temp %>%  
 mutate(rev_type_new = ifelse(rev_type=="30" | rev_type=="60" | rev_type=="63" | rev_type=="76", "78", rev_type_new))


#table(rev_temp$rev_type_new)  # check work


rm(rev_1998_2022)
rm(exp_1998_2022)
```


## Pivoting and Merging

- State employer group insurance contributions should be dropped to avoid double counting costs.    
- Subtract employee insurance premiums from State Employee Healthcare Expenditures (group == 904) - Employee Premiums = Actual state healthcare costs.  

  - $ff\_exp\$exp904 - emp\_premium\$employee\_premiums\_sum = state healthcare costs$

- Local Government Transfers (exp_970) should be on the expenditure side

 

## Revenues

I chose to drop rev_76 for Transfers in and Out because I do not understand why that step occurs in the previously used Stata code. If I keep rev_76 in and include it in rev_78 for All Other Revenues, then the difference between R and Stata code should be resolved.  
  - after Stata code is edited to drop employee insurance premium revenue from all other revenues. Currently it keeps it in AND subtracts it from state healthcare expenditures.  

```{r final-ffrev-table}
ff_rev <- rev_temp %>% 
  group_by(rev_type_new, fy) %>% 
  summarize(sum_receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm=TRUE)/1000000 ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "rev_type_new", values_from = "sum_receipts", names_prefix = "rev_")

ff_rev<- left_join(ff_rev, tax_refund)

#ff_rev <- left_join(ff_rev, pension2_fy22, by=c("fy" = "year"))

#ff_rev <- left_join(ff_rev, eehc2_amt) 
ff_rev <- mutate_all(ff_rev, ~replace_na(.,0))


ff_rev <- ff_rev %>%
  mutate(rev_02 = rev_02 - ref_02,
         rev_03 = rev_03 - ref_03,
         rev_06 = rev_06 - ref_06,
         rev_09 = rev_09 - ref_09,
         rev_21 = rev_21 - ref_21,
         rev_24 = rev_24 - ref_24,
         rev_35 = rev_35 - ref_35

      #   rev_78new = rev_78 #+ pension_amt #+ eehc
         ) %>% 
  select(-c(ref_02:ref_35, rev_99, rev_NA, rev_76#, pension_amt , rev_76,
          #  , eehc
            ))

ff_rev

```


Since I already pivot_wider()ed the table in the previous code chunk, I now change each column's name by using rename() to set new variable names. Ideally the final dataframe would have both the variable name and the variable label but I have not done that yet. 

```{r}

## Expenditures

Create state employee healthcare costs that reflects the health costs minus the optional insurance premiums that came in ($904\_new = 904 - med\_option\_amt\_recent$).

Create exp_970 for all local government transfers (exp_971 + exp_972  + exp_975 + exp_976).

# Clean Table Outputs 

Create total revenues and total expenditures only:

- after aggregating expenditures and revenues, pivoting wider, and left_joining the additional mini dataframes (med_option_recent, pension2_fy22, eehc2_amt), then I want to drop the columns that I no longer want and then pivot_longer(). After pivoting_longer() and creating `rev_long` and `exp_long`, expenditures and revenues are in the same format and can be combined together for the totals and gap each year.

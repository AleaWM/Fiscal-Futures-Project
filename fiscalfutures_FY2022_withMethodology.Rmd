# Data Creation and Cleaning

- Do the FOIA request. In a week or so, they send the expenditure and revenue data as excel files.   
- Checks whether there are any new agencies, re-used funds etc. Create a list of funds, agencies, fund names, etc. for the new year and compare it to the immediate prior year to identify new funds.   
- Update the funds_ab_in file which shows the use of funds. Use criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the all-funds frame.   
- Change the variable names to be consistent with other files such as AGENCYNAME --> agency_name   

- Once variable names are shared over all years of data, combine past years with newest year. All revenue files are in a `revenue` folder that I reference when I set the working directory. When adding new fiscal years, put the the newest year of data for revenue and expenditures in their respective folders. 

Normally, when your receive the new fiscal year files from the Comptrollers office, you will need to change the variable names so that they are consistent with past years. This is an example of reading in the new file and changing the variable names. They seem to change almost every year in the file received from the FOIA so if the code breaks here, check to make sure that the columns you are trying to rename exist and are spelled correctly! Once variables are the same, you will want to save the file as a csv file in its Revenue/Expenditure file and bind all past years and the current year together in one dataframe. 

```{r rename-variables}

#Example code below: Read in excel file and rename columns so that it plays well with the other years' files.
revenue_fy22 <- read_xlsx("Fis_Fut_Rev_2022_Final.xlsx") %>% 
  rename(fy = 'FY',
         fund = 'FUND',
         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',
         agency = 'AGENCY',
         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',
         source = 'REVENUE SOURCE',
         source_name = 'REV SRC NAME',
         receipts = 'AMOUNT'
  ) 

exp_fy22 <- read_xlsx("Fis_Fut_Exp_2022_Final.xlsx") %>% 
  rename(fy = 'FY',
         fund = 'FUND',
         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',
         agency = 'AGENCY',
         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',
         appr_org = 'ORGANIZATION',
         org_name = 'ORGANIZATION NAME',
         obj_seq_type = 'APPROPRIATION',
         wh_approp_name = 'APPROPRIATION NAME',
        # exp_net_xfer = 'NET OF TRANS AMOUNT',
         expenditure = 'EXPENDED'
  ) 

# %>%
#   # these come from ioc_source file after merging
#   mutate(data_source = "exp IOC Aug 2022",
#          object = ,
#          seq = ,
#          type = ,
#          fund_cat = FIND_COLUMN, #create fund_cat column
#          fund_cat_name = FIND_NAME) # create fund_cat_name column



```

 
The code chunk below takes the .dta files for all fiscal years before FY 2022 and binds them together.  Variable names were manually changed by past researchers so that they were consistent across years.

For FY 2023 and after, .dta files can be avoided entirely and .csv or excel files will be used. All files before this year had been saved and passed on as .dta files for Stata code before the transition to R in Fall 2022.  For years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files after binding the dta files together. Variable names must identical to merge files together.

```{r create-rev-csv-FY22, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files after binding the dta files.
setwd("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/revenue")

allrevfiles22 = list.files(path = "C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/revenue",  pattern = ".dta") %>%  lapply(read_dta) %>% bind_rows
#Fy21: 62294 observations, 13 variables
#FY22: 65094 obs, 13 vars

write_csv(allrevfiles22, "allrevfiles22.csv")




setwd("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/expenditures")

allexpfiles22 = list.files(path = "C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/expenditures",  pattern = ".dta") %>%  lapply(read_dta) %>% bind_rows

#fy21 213372 observations, 20 variables
# fy22 225587 obs, 21 vars.

write_csv(allexpfiles22, "allexpfiles22.csv")


```


Code below reads in the csv files created in chunks above (allrevfiles.csv and allrexpfiles.csv). These files contain all years of data combined into one file BEFORE any recoding is done. Do not use this file for summing categories because it is just an inbetween step before recoding revenue and expenditure categories. 

```{r readCSVs}
# combined in past chunks called create-rev-csv and create-exp-csv

allrevfiles22 <- read_csv("allrevfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded
allexpfiles22 <- read_csv("allexpfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded

```







 
```{r eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# not sure if this chunk is needed or useful at all. 
# Something similar was done in old stata code but not consistently and it wasn't used.
# Agency == 799 for Statutory transfers 
#  Object == 1993 is for Interfund cash transfers  
exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% 
  mutate(transfer = ifelse(org_name == "TRANSFERS", 1, 0),
         trans_agency = ifelse(),
         trans_type = ifelse())
```

## Inspecting new FY22 data files

Data files for closed years have been obtained from IOC. The numbers of funds, agencies, organizations, and revenue sources below were found by using pivot tables in the codebook files in the FY2022 Box folder. This could also be done using R and grouping new files by fund, agency, source number, source names, etc..

Revenue File:  
- 684 Fund Numbers   
- 80 Agencies  
- 1184 Revenue source numbers
- 1156 revenue source names

Expenditure File:  
- 708 Fund Numbers   
- 107 Agencies   
- 98 Organization Numbers   
- 313 Organization names  

### Finding new agencies and funds

General steps:  
1. Identify new and reused funds for newest fiscal year. 
2. Recode funds to take into account different fund numbers/names over the years. See [Recoding New and Reused Funds] for code chunk that does this. 
3. Update fund_ab_in_2022.xlsx with any changes from previous fiscal year.   


**New Agencies, Funds, and Organizations from Expenditure files:**

- Using the code below, I found 2 agencies, multiple funds, and a couple organizations that had not been specifically mentioned in the funds_ab_in file - AWM, FY2022.
  - Note: One new org name and org number combo has an expenditure of $600 million for pensions payment. Investigate later.  

```{r}

allrevfiles22 <- read_csv("allrevfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded
allexpfiles22 <- read_csv("allexpfiles22.csv") #combined but not recoded

#### From Expenditure Data #####

# agencies referenced in any year before 2020:

# 15 funds were in FY22 data that were not in past data:
anti_join(funds22, funds_past, by = c("fund", "fund_name")) %>% arrange(fund)

# orgs_pastin the past =  916 org groups ever
orgs_past <- allexpfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(appr_org == as.character(appr_org)) %>% group_by(appr_org, org_name) %>% unique() %>% summarize(Expenditure = sum(expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% drop_na()

# orgs22 # 396 org groups this year


# 4 org number and org name combos are new for FY2022:
anti_join(orgs22, orgs_past, by = c("appr_org", "org_name")) %>% arrange(appr_org)
```


**New Revenue Funds, Sources, and New Agencies:**

```{r}
#### From Revenue Data ####



# agencies_past # 108 agencies ever
agencies_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(agency == as.character(agency)) %>% group_by(agency, agency_name) %>% unique() %>% summarize(Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% drop_na()

agencies22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(agency == as.character(agency)) %>% group_by(agency, agency_name) %>% summarize(Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))

# 0 new agencies in revenue data this year
anti_join(agencies22, agencies_past, by = c("agency", "agency_name")) %>% arrange(agency)


funds_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(fund == as.character(fund)) %>% group_by(fund, fund_name) %>% summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% drop_na()

funds22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(fund == as.character(fund)) %>% group_by(fund, fund_name) %>%  summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% unique() %>% drop_na()

# 19 revenue funds were in FY22 revenue data that were not in past data 
# some could be small fund name changes
anti_join(funds22, funds_past, by = c("fund", "fund_name")) %>% arrange(fund)



sources_past <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy < 2022) %>% mutate(source == as.character(source)) %>% group_by(source, source_name) %>% summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% drop_na()

sources22 <- allrevfiles22  %>% filter(fy == 2022) %>% mutate(source == as.character(source)) %>% group_by(source, source_name) %>%  summarize(count = n(), Receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% unique()


# 20 revenue sources were in FY22 data that were not in past data 
# some could be small source name changes:
anti_join(sources22, sources_past, by = c("source", "source_name")) %>% arrange(source)

```

Sources 2737 through 2756 were not found in the IOC_source file so I added them. They do NOT have a rev_type until the Fiscal Futures researchers discuss which revenue type the sources fall under and if they should be included in the analysis in general.


### Recoding New and Reused Funds

New funds will need to be manually added to the funds_ab_in excel file and determined if they should or should not be included in Fiscal Future calculations. __Copy info from word file here on how to add funds to excel file__.

For funds that were reused once, a 9 replaces the 0 as the first digit. If reused twice, then the first two values are 10.   
- Ex. 0350 --> 9350 because its use changed.   
- Ex. 0367 becomes 10367 because its use has changed twice now. There was fund 0367 originally, then its use changed and it was recoded as 9367, and now it changed again so it is a 10367.  
- Excel file also has alternative ways to name funds (e.g. 0397-A and 0397-B) and variables for the year that the fund stopped being used. These have not been updated consistently over the years but it is useful information when trying to find any coding mistakes from the past.   

New or reused funds revenue file recoding:
```{r recode-rev-funds}

### Tax refunds 

Aggregate expenditures: Save tax refunds as negative revenue. Code refunds to match the rev_type codes (02=income taxes, 03 = corporate income taxes, 06=sales tax, 09=motor fuel tax, 24=insurance taxes and fees, 35 = all other tax refunds).

`tax_refund` amounts are removed from expenditure totals and instead subtracted from revenue totals (since they were tax refunds).


### Pension Expenditures



> 300 million pension stabilization payment from fund 0319, object == 1900 for lump sums and other purposes. This is a type of pension contribution, right?

State payments to the following pension systems:  

• Teachers Retirement System (TRS)  
  - New POB bond in 2019: Accelerated Bond Fund paid benefits in advance as lump sum
• State Employee Retirement System (SERS)  
• State University Retirement System (SURS)  
• Judges Retirement System (JRS)  
• General Assembly Retirement System (GARS)  


Employer contributions for pensions are excluded from analysis to avoid double counting the cost of pensions. Expenditures with object 4430 for pensions, benefits, and annuities  appears in items from funds 0473, 0477, 0479, 0481, (TRS, JRS, SERS, GARS), 0755, 0786, 0787, 0788, 0789 (deferred compensation plan, GAR excess benefit, JRS excess benefit, SER excess benefit, TRS excess benefit) are NOT included in the analysis. All are coded with in_ff=0 in the fund_ab_in.xlsx file of funds.
- Some expenditures with object=4430 are paid for with Pension obligation bond funds (fund == 0825). In past years, some POB funded expenditures were moved to revenue side. We are no longer doing this as of FY2021. 

State pension contributions are largely captured with object=4431. **(State payments into pension fund)**    
  - includes 8 billion payment in 2004 that creates large peak in expenditure graphs   
  
Other items to be aware of that may contain useful pension context:   
- object = 1298 is for Purchase of Investments and is excluded from analysis except for a couple exceptions during 2010 and 2011.  
- object = 1900 for pension stabilization under lump sums  
- object = 1167 and 1168 is for Employer pension contributions but is not used as of FY2022.

### Drop Interfund transfers

### State employee healthcare costs


State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for "health care coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance act." The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund. We subtract the share that came from employee contributions. Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.


Fund = 0457 is "Group insurance premium", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0193 is "Local govt health insurance reserve", in=ff = 0  
fund = 0477 is "Community College Health Insurance", in=ff = 0.     
- had large amount in early years  
Fund = 0907 = health insurance reserve, in_ff = 1  
Fund = 9939 is "group self-insurers' insolv", in_ff = 1  
Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in_ff = 0  
Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in_ff = 1   

Employer contributions for group insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare.

All employer contributions are coded as object = 1180. 

- eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an employer contribution of some type to some fund   
- eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an employer contribution to health insurance

> This code chunk above for dealing with group insurance means that healthcare costs need to be added to expenditures after other group names are assigned. Then employee contributions/insurance premiums from the revenue side need to be subtracted from the total cost of employee healthcare for the net cost.


### Local Transfers

Separate transfers to local from parent agencies that come from DOR(492) or Transportation (494). Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures, not negative revenue.

The share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are NOT included.)

The five corresponding revenue items are:  

• Local share of Personal Income Tax   
• Local share of General Sales Tax   
• Personal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income  
• Personal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities  
• Local share of Motor Fuel Tax 
  - Transportation Renewal Fund 0952

### Debt Service


Debt Service expenditures include interest payment on both short-term and long-term debt. We do not include escrow or principal payments. 

**Decision from Sept 30 2022:** We are no longer including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect. 

Logic: interest for long-term debt that likely funds capital projects.  

**Objects:**    
8813 interest **INCLUDE AS COST**  
8811 is for principle **EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure**  
8841 is for escrow payments **EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure**  
8800 is for capital projects (Build Illinois Bonds, Civic Center, Tollway **EXCLUDE tollway in debt cost**
  - Note: debt principle and interest are both included in capital projects because they are combined in the data observations; bond proceeds are not considered a revenue source 


**Obj_seq_type:**       
- Exclude: Bond principle payments: obj_seq_type == 88110008   
- Exclude: Short term borrowing principle: obj_seq_type == 88110108  
- Include: General Obligation Bond Interest: obj_seq_type == 88130000 & 88130008  
- Include: Interest on short-term borrowing: 88130108  
- Exclude: Escrow payment == 88410008  
- Include: Build IL Bonds principal AND interest  
  - Tollway is obj_seq_type == 88000055, filter out fund == 0455 to remove tollway  
  - fund == 0455 is the IL State Toll Highway fund, items mostly for operations and maintenance  

```{r tollway, include = FALSE}

### Medicaid

__Medicaid.__ That portion of the Healthcare and Family Services (or Public Aid in earlier years, agency code 478) budget for Medical (appr_organization code 65) for awards and grants (object codes 4400 and 4900).  

> State CURE will remain in the Medicaid expenditure category due to the nature of it being federal funds providing public health services and funding to locations that provide public services.

- Uses same appropriation name of "HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELIEF" and fund == 0793 and obj_seq_type == 49000000. So can defend the "mistake" of including healthcare provider relief as Medicaid expenditure. 


```{r Medicaid-check, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
medicaid_check <- exp_temp %>% filter(agency=="478" & (appr_org=="01" | appr_org == "65" | appr_org=="88") & (object=="4900" | object=="4400"))
# This includes the State CURE fund

medicaid_check %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(sum = sum(expenditure)) %>% arrange(-fy)  # looks good I think AWM

# if we want state CURE as public health or other group number
# exp_temp <- exp_temp %>% mutate(group = if_else(fund == "0324" & agency=="478" & appr_org == "65" & object=="4900", "478", as.character(group)))

All expenditures recoded but not aggregated: Allows for inspection of individual expenditures within larger categories. This stage of the data is extremely useful for investigating almost all questions we have about the data. 

Note that these are the raw figures BEFORE we take the additional steps:   

- Subtract employee insurance premiums from State Employee Healthcare expenditures  
- Subtract tax refunds from tax revenues by revenue type.  
- Subtract employee pension contributions (originally a dropped revenue) from State Pension expenditures

- **NOT DOING ANYMORE**: ~~Add employee health costs and certain pension contributions to All Other Revenues~~ 




# Modify  Revenue data


Revenue Categories NOT included in Fiscal Futures:   
- 32.  Garnishment-Levies.  (State is fiduciary, not beneficiary.)  
- 45.  Student Fees-Universities.  (Excluded from state-level budget.)  
- 51.  Retirement Contributions (of individuals and non-state entities).    
- 66.  Proceeds, Investment Maturities.  (Not sustainable flow.)  
- 72.  Bond Issue Proceeds.  (Not sustainable flow.)     
- 75.  Inter-Agency Receipts.  
- 79.  Cook County Intergovernmental Transfers.  (State is not beneficiary.)  
- 98.  Prior Year Refunds.    

**All Other Sources** 

Expanded to include the following smaller sources:  
- 30.  Horse Racing Taxes & Fees.  
- 60.  Other Grants and Contracts.  
- 63.  Investment Income.    


For aggregating revenue, use the rev_1998_2022 dataframe, join the funds_ab_in_2022 file to it, and then join the ioc_source_type file to the dataset. Remember: You need to update the funds_ab_in and ioc_source_type file every year! 

```{r create-rev-temp, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# fund info to revenue for all years
rev_temp <- inner_join(rev_1998_2022, funds_ab_in_2022, by = "fund") %>% arrange(source)

# need to update the ioc_source_type file every year! 
ioc_source_type <- readxl::read_xlsx("C:/Users/aleaw/OneDrive/Documents/PhD Fall 2021 - Spring 2022/Merriman RA/Fiscal Futures FY2022/Replication-Files/ioc_source_updated22_AWM.xlsx")

rev_temp <- left_join(rev_temp, ioc_source_type, by = "source")
# automatically used source, source name does not match for the join to work using source_name
```

Update Agencies: Early agencies replaced by successors
```{r agencies-rev}

    (agency=="438"| agency=="475" |agency == "505") ~ "440",
    # financial institution &  professional regulation &
     # banks and real estate  --> coded as  financial and professional reg
    agency == "473" ~ "588", # nuclear safety moved into IEMA
    (agency =="531" | agency =="577") ~ "532", # coded as EPA
    (agency =="556" | agency == "538") ~ "406", # coded as agriculture
    agency == "560" ~ "592", # IL finance authority (fire trucks and agriculture stuff)to state fire marshal
    agency == "570" & fund == "0011" ~ "494",   # city of Chicago road fund to transportation
    TRUE ~ (as.character(agency)))) 
```


### Federal to State Transfers

```{r create-rev-federal-transfers}
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(
    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type=="57" & agency=="478" & (source=="0618"|source=="2364"|source=="0660"|source=="1552"| source=="2306"| source=="2076"|source=="0676"|source=="0692"), "58", rev_type),
    rev_type_name = ifelse(rev_type=="58", "FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION", rev_type_name),

    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type=="6", "06", rev_type),
    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type=="9", "09", rev_type)) 

rev_temp %>% 
  filter(rev_type == "58" | rev_type == "59" | rev_type == "57") %>% 
  group_by(fy, rev_type, rev_type_name) %>% 
  summarise(receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=receipts,color=rev_type)) +
  labs(title = "Federal to State Transfers", 
       y = "Millions of Dollars", x = "",
       caption = "57 = Other; 58 = Medicaid Reimbursements; 59=Transportation")
```

### Pension Contributions

Employee contributions to pension are a revenue source for the state. In order to get the net cost of  pensions for the state, employee contributions should be subtracted in order to calculate net costs.  

- current year employee revenue source = 0573   
- contributions by employee == 572 (stops at 2011)  


```{r}
#pension_rev_check <- rev_temp %>% filter(source == "0572" | source == "0573" | source == "0574" | source == "0577" | source == "1982" | source == "2567")

#write_csv(pension_rev_check, "pension_revenue_check.csv")


# current year employee revenue source = 0573, contributions by employee == 572 (stops at 2011)
pension_rev <- rev_temp %>% 
  filter(rev_type == "51" & source == "0573" | source == "0572")


rev_type <- anti_join(rev_temp, pension_rev)

pension_rev_yearly <- rev_temp %>% 
  filter(rev_type == "51" & source == "0573" | source == "0572") %>% 
  group_by(fy, rev_type) %>%
  summarise(pension_rev_sum = sum(receipts, na.rm=TRUE)/1000000) %>% select(-rev_type)

```

`pension_rev` should be subtracted from the state pension expenditures. Employee contributions to pensions are a revenue source. We want net pension cost, therefore subtract employee contributions from pension costs. 

### Health Insurance Premiums from Employees

Employee insurance premiums for healthcare are a revenue source for the state. In order to get the true cost of State Employee Healthcare, total employee insurance premiums should be subtracted from the healthcare expenditure total (exp_904 - premiums). Gather all employee premiums into `opt_premiums` and subtract it from the Expenditure table after aggregating and pivoting steps.

0120 = ins prem-option life
0120 = ins prem-optional life/univ

0347 = optional health - HMO
0348 = optional health - dental 
0349 = optional health - univ/local SI
0350 = optional health - univ/local
0351 = optional health - retirement
0352 = optional health - retirement SI
0353 = optional health - retire/dental
0354 = optional health - retirement hmo

2199-2209 = various HMOs, dental, health plans from Health Insurance Reserve (fund)

```{r step-3.6-insurance-premiums}

opt_premiums_CHECK <- rev_temp %>% 
  filter((fund=="0907" | fund == "0457") & (source=="0120" | source=="0121" | (source>"0345" & source<"0357") | (source>"2199" & source<"2209")                                            ) 
         )

#collect optional insurance premiums to fund 0907 for use in eehc expenditure  
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(med_option_recent = ifelse(
    fund=="0907" & (source=="0120"| source=="0121"| (source>"0345" & source<"0357")|(source>"2199" & source<"2209")), 1, 0),
    
    # adds more rev_type codes
    rev_type = case_when(
      fund =="0427" ~ "12", # pub utility tax
      fund == "0742" | fund == "0473" ~ "24", # insurance and fees
      fund == "0976" ~ "36",# receipts from rev producing
      fund == "0392" |fund == "0723" ~ "39", # licenses and fees
      fund == "0656" ~ "78", #all other rev sources
      TRUE ~ as.character(rev_type)))
# if not mentioned, then rev_type as it was



# optional insurance premiums = employee insurance premiums
med_option_recent <- rev_temp %>%
  group_by(fy, med_option_recent) %>%
  summarize(med_option_amt_recent = sum(receipts)/1000000) %>%
  filter(med_option_recent == 1) %>%
  rename(year = fy) %>% 
  select(-med_option_recent)

med_option_long <- rev_temp %>%  filter(med_option_recent == 1)
# 361 observations have med_option_recent == 1


rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% filter(med_option_recent != 1)
# could also do an antijoin with rev_temp and med_option dataframes


```

You must then subtract the employee premiums from the state healthcare expenditures totals. Employee premiums on the revenue side should have receipts coded as $0 or be dropped using anti_join(). 


### Transfers in and Out: 

**I don't have much faith in the transfers in and out steps- AWM**

I am currently choosing to exclude the totals from this step. Overall, this decreases the total revenues in "All Other Revenues" by a few million dollars.

- in_from_out <- c("0847", "0867", "1175", "1176", "1177", "1178", "1181", "1182", "1582", "1592", "1745", "1982", "2174", "2264")   
- See the methodology document for the list of what these sources/funds are. 


```{r step-3.8}
rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  filter(in_ff == 1) %>% 
  mutate(local = ifelse(is.na(local), 0, local)) %>% # drops all revenue observations that were coded as "local == 1"
  filter(local != 1)

# 1175 doesnt exist?
in_from_out <- c("0847", "0867", "1175", "1176", "1177", "1178", "1181", "1182", "1582", "1592", "1745", "1982", "2174", "2264")

# what does this actually include:
# all are items with rev_type = 75 originally. 
in_out_df <- rev_type %>%
  mutate(infromout = ifelse(source %in% in_from_out, 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(infromout == 1)

rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% 
  mutate(rev_type_new = ifelse(source %in% in_from_out, "76", rev_type))
# if source contains any of the codes in in_from_out, code them as 76 (all other rev).
```


```{r droprevtypes}
# revenue types to drop
drop_type <- c("32", "45", "51", 
               "66", "72", "75", "79", "98")

# drops Blank, Student Fees, Retirement contributions, proceeds/investments,
# bond issue proceeds, interagency receipts, cook IGT, Prior year refunds.


rev_temp <- rev_temp %>% filter(!rev_type_new %in% drop_type)
# keep observations that do not have a revenue type mentioned in drop_type

table(rev_temp$rev_type_new)

rev_temp %>% 
  group_by(fy, rev_type_new) %>% 
  summarize(total_reciepts = sum(receipts)/1000000) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = rev_type_new, values_from = total_reciepts, names_prefix = "rev_") 

# combines smallest 4  categories to to "Other"
# they were the 4 smallest in past years, are they still the 4 smallest? 

rev_temp <- rev_temp %>%  
  mutate(rev_type_new = ifelse(rev_type=="30" | rev_type=="60" | rev_type=="63" | rev_type=="76", "78", rev_type_new))


#table(rev_temp$rev_type_new)  # check work


rm(rev_1998_2022)
rm(exp_1998_2022)
```

```{r revenue-78-check, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}

filter(rev_temp) %>% 
  filter(fy == 2022 | fy == 2021) %>%  write.csv("rev-recoded-2022.csv")
  #group_by(fund_name) %>% 
 # summarize(sum = sum(receipts)) %>% arrange(-sum)

```


# Pivoting and Merging

- State employee contributions (eehc from eehc2_amt) should be subtracted from state employee healthcare expenditures. State employer contributions should be dropped to avoid double counting costs.   
- State employee health insurance premiums should be subtracted from state healthcare costs for the net healthcare cost. 
- Subtract employee insurance premiums from State Employee Healthcare Expenditures (group == 904) - Employee Premiums = Actual state healthcare costs.  

  - $ff\_exp\$exp904 - med\_option\$med\_option\_amt\_recent = state healthcare costs$
  
- Employee contributions should be subtracted from from state pension costs. 
    -$ff\_exp\$exp_901 - rev\_51 = state pension costs$  even though rev_type == 51 (retirement contributions) is dropped based on past code.
    
    - _Stata code, no longer doing: State pension contributions funded by bonds (pension_amt from pension2_fy22) should be added to Other revenues_   
 


- Local Government Transfers (exp_970) should be on the expenditure side

 

## Revenues

I chose to drop rev_76 for Transfers in and Out because I do not understand why that step occurs in the previously used Stata code. If I keep rev_76 in and include it in rev_78 for All Other Revenues, then the difference between R and Stata code should be resolved.  
  - after Stata code is edited to drop employee insurance premium revenue from all other revenues. Currently it keeps it in AND subtracts it from state healthcare expenditures.  

```{r final-ffrev-table}
ff_rev <- rev_temp %>% 
  group_by(rev_type_new, fy) %>% 
  summarize(sum_receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm=TRUE)/1000000 ) %>%

Since I already pivot_wider()ed the table in the previous code chunk, I now change each column's name by using rename() to set new variable names. Ideally the final dataframe would have both the variable name and the variable label but I have not done that yet.

## Expenditures

Create state employee healthcare costs that reflects the health costs minus the optional insurance premiums that came in ($904\_new = 904 - med\_option\_amt\_recent$).

Create exp_970 for all local government transfers (exp_971 + exp_972  + exp_975 + exp_976).

```{r}

# Clean Table Outputs 

Create total revenues and total expenditures only:

- after aggregating expenditures and revenues, pivoting wider, and left_joining the additional mini dataframes (med_option_recent, pension2_fy22, eehc2_amt), then I want to drop the columns that I no longer want and then pivot_longer(). After pivoting_longer() and creating `rev_long` and `exp_long`, expenditures and revenues are in the same format and can be combined together for the totals and gap each year.

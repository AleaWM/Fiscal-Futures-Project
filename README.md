# Fiscal Futures Project

The IGPA Fiscal Futures Project is dedicated to informing the public and policymakers in Illinois about long-term budget issues and began in 2008.

The Fiscal Futures Project tracks Illinois' fiscal situation using detailed revenue and expenditure data from the Illinois Office of the Comptroller (IOC) since 1998. The data supplied by the Comptroller's office covers essentially all state spending and revenue, appropriated and non-appropriated within both general and special funds. Using an "all funds" basis of fiscal categories, we aggregate the IOC data into a meaningful and consistent set of revenue and expenditure categories focusing on the function of spending rather than making a distinction between fund names. This approach allows us to develop consistent time series even when government functions move between departments. We then provide a basic snapshot of Illinois' current fiscal condition and implications regarding long-term fiscal outlook.
